**Clipy** is a fully open-source, bloat-free Electron desktop application for downloading and editing YouTube videos in their **original quality** without compression or re-encoding. It provides a clean, advanced, and completely free alternative to proprietary tools, with a strong emphasis on user privacy and a high-quality user experience.

All processing is done locally on your machine. We use the modern InnerTube API for fetching video information first, with a fallback to `ytdl-core`, ensuring reliability and speed without compromising your privacy.

## Features

-   **Original Quality Downloads**: Download videos in the highest quality available with no re-encoding.
-   **Built-in Video Editor**: A timeline-based editor powered by FFmpeg for lossless trimming, splitting, and merging.
-   **100% Privacy Focused**: All processing is done locally. No servers, no tracking, no telemetry.
-   **Completely Free & Open Source**: No ads, no paywalls, no premium features. Licensed under the MIT license.
-   **Cross-Platform**: A single, consistent experience on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
-   **Modern UI**: Built with React, TypeScript, and Shadcn UI for a clean and responsive interface with full theme support.
